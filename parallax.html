            this is a section one. this is used to crestr the parallax effect.Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.


            Use a container element and add a background image to the container with a specific height. Then use the background-attachment: fixed to create the actual parallax effect. The other background properties are used to center and scale the image perfectly:

            Parallax scrolling does not always work on mobile devices/smart phones. However, you can use media queries to turn off the effect on mobile devices (see last example on this page).

              this is a section THREE. this is used to crestr the parallax effect.he example above used pixels to set the height of the image. If you want to use percent, for example 100%, to make the image fit the whole screen, set the height of the parallax container to 100%. Note: You must also apply height: 100% to both <html> and <body>:
